The Galaxy Fold 2 has fixed perhaps a lot of the pressing issues with the Fold 1 and made it faster and better.The hinge is perhaps the most important piece of any foldable tech and Samsung definitely delivers in this regard. Initially I was very worried about opening and closing my phone but the transition is pretty smooth and within five minutes of holding this device you will get used it it. (Tip: Don't press the screen when folding but using the bottom-middle area of the hinge and fold your phone it will protect the screen longer)Whilst many people have concerns with the durability of the phone, I have already dropped it twice (both when it was closed thankfully) and so far it has survived but I don't recommend you doing it.Performance is excellent with 12 gigs of ram, latest processor from snapdragon and am excellent GPU. Games and applications run smoothly without any lag. Sound is excellent with dual speakers! Multiple apps can also run simultaneously without issues. Recommend getting the goodlock app to unlock several features of the phone and customize them further.Price is sadly very very steep though I couldn't resist and bought it anyway but I feel like it should have atleast provided the galaxy buds live or pro along with the phone. But at least you do get the wired AKG earbuds which are excellent. No case is provided which is another downer. Samsung if you are selling a phone at a premium price you should atleast provide a premium accessory!Overall I'm definitely loving this phone.</td>\n",

I don't do professional photography with my smartphones but do expect them to have fabulous cameras when I cannot lug my Panasonic out!Anyway, my husband gifted me the Samsung Z Fold 2 (256 GB) in Mystic Bronze for my birthday this Jan. I was quite happy with my OnePlus 6T that had an amazing camera and all the other features. However, the Samsung Z Fold 2 is one of those gadgets that you didn't even know you needed till you get your hands on one. It's a true marvel of technology! I am treating it gingerly that I still haven't installed my SIM card in it - it's like a new friend, and we are just getting to know each other.Here's what I LOVE about it:1. I think I'm going to go back to reading! E-reading apps like Kindle and Aldiko look great and the dual screen is almost the same size as the physical Kindle.2. Multi-tasking rocks and is so so easy to master. I opened up an e-book on one window and the other window I opened up Goodreads on Google to read the book reviews. I can see myself doing that for news, dictionaries, etc of even reading product reviews on one window and shopping online on the other.3. Good cameras - many of them! Selfie mode with rear cameras is a cool thing.What I DON'T LIKE1. The wires earphones that come with the phone seem a little tacky.. for the price they charge, they could have added Samsung Buds or some wireless option.2. There is no case so I had to buy the Spigen case in Mystic Bronze for added protection.The bigger screen definitely needs some getting used to... Some may say that the front screen is to narrow and the unfolded screen is too wide! However, it's a true joy to watch video and multimedia with Fold 2.</td>\n",

Phone was decent, but it started getting hung when I used multiple apps. Then, I took risk and went for Fold 2. Believe me, this is the best phone with almost all the features. Phone is designed so smartly and this feature of using tab and phone simultaneously is really very useful. There is no problem of hung phone, slow speed etc. Overall, a must buy if your budget permits.And yes, it stands you out from the crowd.
